These are the GeoPAT 2 Unix executable programs, compiled for Mac OS with the Apple M1 Max processor. This is an ARM64 architecture.
They are the programs explained in the GeoPAT 2 user's manual at https://rawgit.com/Nowosad/geopat2_manual/master/output/GeoPAT2_Manual.pdf

They were compiled on an Apple Macbook Pro, operating system macOS 14.5 "Sonora".
They will likely work with other OS versions, on the same processor.
They will definitely not work on x86 family Intel processors, for that they would have to be re-compiled on those systems.

Some changes were made to the GeoPAT 2 makefile, and gdal also hadto be compiled and installed for this architecture, before compiling GeoPAT2 programs..

These programs are executables and can be run from a shell script, or with R's `system` command.
